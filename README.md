# KeyGen
KeyGen is a Easy to use Python script that allows you to craft as many random pass-keys or pins you want, how you want them.
How to Use:

Run the script and follow the prompts to enter the number of keys, the length of each segment, the number of segments in each key, whether to use letters or digits, if dashes should be added between segments, and the name of the output file. The script will generate the keys and save them to the specified file.
